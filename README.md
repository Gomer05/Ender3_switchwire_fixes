# Ender3_switchwire_fixes
 Some fixes to popular ender 3 switchwire conversions

 Triano[https://github.com/walttriano/Ender_3Pro_Switchwire] and DaRk_dOg [https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW] have produced an Ender 3 switchwire conversion mod. I'vew found a few issues during construcion and I thought I'd share my fixes

## Changes
- ### 2022-02-13
  - 2 Fixed XZ blocks where the spacer isn't long enough
  - added some 5mm ABS washers in case M5x35 BHCS aren't available
  - Added [Y motor mount](Y-Axis_2022-Feb-12_03-43-32AM-000_CustomizedView12767374662.jpg) for V2 with the pulley reversed, so a 48mm stepper like an E3D High Torque can be used, or the voron spec LDOs of simialr specification and size. 

## Todo
- ~~Upload rear motor mount~~
- Upload Y tensioner quickfix
- X-Z motor mount screw length changes
- Upper Block screw length changes
