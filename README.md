# Ender3_switchwire_fixes
 Some fixes to popular ender 3 switchwire conversions

 [Triano](https://github.com/walttriano/Ender_3Pro_Switchwire) and [DaRk_dOg](https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW) have produced an Ender 3 switchwire conversion mod. I'vew found a few issues during construcion and I thought I'd share my fixes

## Changes
- ### 2022-02-16
  - Added modified rear deck for Y motor mod. Compatible with V2 and Pro Y rail.
- ### 2022-02-14
  - Changed XZ blocks for [clearance](XZ-blocks/clearance.png), they don't sit flat to the extrusion
  - Added a T-slot version with slightly differenc clearances
  - Added my Y-idler fix to [very weak part](Y-idler/weak-slider.png)
- ### 2022-02-13
  - 2 Fixed XZ blocks where the spacer isn't long enough
  - added some 5mm ABS washers in case M5x35 BHCS aren't available
  - Added [Y motor mount](Y-motor/Y-Axis_2022-Feb-12_03-43-32AM-000_CustomizedView12767374662.jpg) for V2 with the pulley reversed, so a 48mm stepper like an E3D High Torque can be used, or the voron spec LDOs of simialr specification and size. 

## Todo
- ~~Upload rear motor mount~~
- ~~Upload Y tensioner quickfix~~
- X-Z motor mount screw length changes (using washer works)
- Upper Block screw length changes (using washers works)
- Add 10mm spacer to Y-axis, remove extension
- ~~Adapt printable deck for Y-motor~~
