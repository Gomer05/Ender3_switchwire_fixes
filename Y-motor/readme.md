# Compact motor mount
For DaRk_dOg and Triano's mods, allows the use of a larger Y stepper motor without having clearance issues with the enclosure or the y carriage by inverting the pulley.

Pictured is a 48mm e3d high-torque motor fitting easily in the same space as the original motor. I recommend at least using the extruder motor and having some Y over-travel so all of the bed can be covered with a mesh. This is slightly more fiddly and requires smaller SHCS not BHCS screws, but I've been using it for months on VS.373 successfully.

Note I may have made a mistake with the BOM, the specified switchwire motors are 39mm [NEMA17 Motor 17HS15-1504S1](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/nema-17-bipolar-45ncm-63-74oz-in-1-5a-42x42x39mm-4-wires-w-1m-cable-connector-17hs15-1504s1) and I picked these [e3d High Torque 0.9Â°](https://e3d-online.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/360016686858/High_Torque_Motor.pdf) and likely sanity checked the size against trident/2.4 BOM motors.
