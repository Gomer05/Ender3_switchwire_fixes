# Compact motor mount
For DaRk_dOg and Triano's mods, allows the use of a larger Y stepper motor without having clearance issues with the enclosure or the y carriage by inverting the pulley.

Pictured is a 48mm e3d high-torque motor fitting easily in the same space as the original motor. I recommend at least using the extruder motor and having some Y over-travel so all of the bed can be covered with a mesh. This is slightly more fiddly and requires smaller SHCS not BHCS screws, but I've been using it for months on VS.373 successfully.
